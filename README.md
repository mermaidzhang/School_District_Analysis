# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 
## Overview of Project
Since there is evidence of academic dishonesty from Thomas High School, we ought to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once replaced the math and reading scores, I would repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
## Results
- The district summary was not affected except the toal students number drecreased by 461, the average changes were insignificant 
- However for the school summary, but excluding Gr9ders, the % passing both madn and reading significantly increased by around 20-30%
- this change potentially make Thomas High School ranked higher and ended up in the top-5 performing schools 

## Summary 
The changes make Thomas High School perform better.
The rest of metrics such as spending per capita for other schools remained unchanged.
